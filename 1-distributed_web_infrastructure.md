# Distributed Web Infrastructure

## Why add a load balancer?

A load balancer is used to distribute traffic between multiple servers.
This helps make sure no single server gets too much traffic.

## What algorithm does the load balancer use?

A common algorithm is Round Robin.
It sends each new visitor to the next server in the list.
For example: visitor 1 goes to server A, visitor 2 to server B, visitor 3 to server C, and then back to A.

## Active-Active or Active-Passive? What is the difference?

  - Active-Active:
    All servers are working at the same time.
    This gives better performance and handles more traffic.

  - Active-Passive:
    One server is active, and the others are on standby.
    A standby server takes over only if the active one fails.

Most web systems use Active-Active for better speed and availability.

## Why add multiple web or application servers?

We add more servers to:
  - Handle more users,
  - Avoid downtime if one server fails,
  - Deploy updates without stopping the whole site.

## How does a Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) database cluster work?

This setup has one main database and one or more copies.
  - The Primary database handles all changes (like adding or updating data).
  - The Replicas are copies used only for reading data.
  - They stay up to date with the Primary.

## What is the difference between the Primary and Replica from the applicationâ€™s point of view?
From the application's point of view, the Primary database handles all write operations (like insert and update), while the Replica databases are read-only. The application sends writes to the Primary, and it can read from the Replicas to reduce the load on the Primary and improve performance.
